# Vortex Core Keyboard Layout
## Optimized for Programming

The files in this repository represents my custom keymapping for use with the [Vortex Core Keyboard](http://www.vortexgear.tw/vortex2_2.asp?kind=47&kind2=224&kind3=&kind4=1036).

This is a similar layout, except that the shifted number row is given first order status using FN1 modifier. The numbers themselves are accessed via the FN key in numpad layout.

Same as the first except with COLEMAK layout.
